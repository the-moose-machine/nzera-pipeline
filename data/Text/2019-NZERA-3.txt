COSTS DETERMINATION OF THE AUTHORITY

[1]

In a determination dated 26 November 2018 ([2018] NZERA Auckland 370), I found

that the Applicant, Mr David Horan, had been unjustifiably dismissed from his employment
by the Respondent, Golden Fork Limited (GFL).

[2]

Costs were reserved in the hope that the parties would be able to settle this issue

between themselves. Unfortunately they have been unable to do so, and both parties have
filed submissions in respect of costs.

[3]

The matter involved a half day meeting.

[4]

Mr Gelb, citing actual costs (post-mediation) of $10,584.61 is seeking a contribution

to costs in the sum $7,500.00.

[5]

Ms Eden, on behalf of GFL, submits that an award of $2,999.99 is appropriate.

Submissions for the Applicant

[6]

Mr Gelb submits that the determination of the Authority found that Mr Horan had a

personal grievance as a result of his dismissal. Mr Horan was awarded lost wages, holiday
pay and compensation for humiliation, upset and injury to feelings. In addition a penalty was
awarded against GFL for non-payment to Mr Horan of the full amount of his holiday pay.

[7]

The investigation only occupied slightly in excess of half a day, and I consider that a

starting point in light of the normal daily tariff for a one day hearing of $4,500.00 should be
$2,250.00.

[8]

Mr Gelb submits that Mr Horan made two Calderbank Offers to GFL to resolve the

matter prior to the substantive matter being heard.1 A Calderbank Offer is an offer ‘without
prejudice save as to costs’ offer.

[9]

A Calderbank Offer was made in a letter headed ‘Without prejudice save as to costs’

dated 1March 2018 (the First Calderbank Letter). This offered that Mr Horan would settle the
matter on a full and final basis provided that GFL paid him a total sum of $10,000.00 being
comprised of $6,50000 as compensation pursuant to s 123(1)(c )(i) of the Employment
Relations Act 2000 (the Act), and a contribution to Mr Horan’s costs of $3,500.00, plus GST.
Attached was a draft record of settlement document.

[10]

GFL responded on 10 September 2018 that enclosed a Calderbank Offer in response

(the Counter-Offer). GFL rejected the First Calderbank Offer and, in an attached letter
headed “Without prejudice save as to costs’, counter-offered to settle the matter in a total sum
of $3,500.00 pursuant to s 123(1)(c )(i) of the Act.

[11]

Mr Horan responded to the Counter-Offer by making a further Calderbank Offer by

way of an email dated 16 October 2018 (the Second Calderbank Offer). Mr Horan offered to
settle in a reduced sum of $4,000.00 pursuant to s 123(1)(c )(i) of the Act, and costs of
$4,000.00 plus GST. This Second Calderbank Offer advised that it would expire if not
accepted in full by 9.00 p.m. on 24 October 2018. It was not accepted by GFL and expired.
Submissions for the Respondent

[12]

Ms Eden submits that the invoices being relied upon by the Applicant are excessive

or an otherwise unreasonable approach to hourly rates and resources.

1

Calderbank v Calderbank [1976] Fam 93 (CA)

[13]

In particular Ms Eden submits that Mr Gelb’s standard hourly rate is $295.00 and that

the invoices indicate that Mr Gelb took on the majority of the work in the case including time
attendance on tasks that are administrative in nature. This is despite Mr Gelb’s website
stating that his business is a two person team with one administrative employee who could
have been expected to undertake the administrative work .

[14]

Ms Eden further submits that the travel time claimed by Mr Gelb appears to be

excessive.
Principles

[15]

The power of the Authority to award costs arises from Section 15 of Schedule 2 of the

Employment Relations Act 2000 which states:

15 Power to award costs
(1) The Authority may order any party to a matter to pay to any other party
such costs and expenses (including expenses of witnesses) as the
Authority thinks reasonable.
(2) The Authority may apportion any such costs and expenses between the
parties or any of them as it thinks fit, and may at any time vary or alter
any such order in such manner as it thinks reasonable.

[16]

Costs are at the discretion of the Authority, as observed by former Chief Judge

Colgan in NZ Automobile Association Inc v McKay2.

[17]

The principles and the approach adopted by the Authority on which an award of

costs are made are well settled and outlined in PBO Limited (formerly Rush Security Ltd) v
Da Cruz (Da Cruz)3.
Determination

[18]
[19]

It is a principle set out in Da Cruz4 that costs are not to be used as a punishment.
It is a principle set out in PBO Limited (formerly Rush Security Ltd) v Da Cruz5 that

costs are modest. Costs are also reasonable as observed by the Court of Appeal in Victoria
University of Wellington v Alton-Lee6 at para [48] “As to quantification, the principle is one of
reasonable contribution to costs actually and reasonably incurred.”

[20]

I consider that the Calderbank Offers should be taken into consideration in

determining the appropriate level of costs.

[21]

Whilst taking note of the comments made by Judge Inglis as regards the ameliorating

of the ‘steely’ approach noted in the judgment in Stevens v Hapag-Lloyd (NZ) Ltd7 which
referred to ‘significant costs awards’, I consider that Calderbank Offers may still be taken
into consideration in the matter of costs in the Authority on the basis that the public interest in
the fair and expeditious resolution of disputes would be adversely affected if parties were
permitted to ignore without prejudice offers without costs being impacted8.

[22]

Mr Horan was awarded a total sum of $4,605.00 by the Authority (in respect of

unpaid holiday pay entitlement, lost wages and compensation plus a proportion of a penalty
award).

[23]

The Calderbank Offers were both made in advance of the Investigation Meeting and

included an amount in respect of costs. There was therefore due time for GFL to consider
them fully prior to taking any part in that proceeding.

[24]

In terms of the amount suggested by Mr Horan by way of compensation the Second

Calderbank Offer offered to settle in an amount which was slightly less than Mr Horan was
subsequently awarded by the Authority.

[25]

The Counter-Offer was in a sum less than Mr Horan was subsequently awarded in the

Authority and did not include a sum in respect of costs.

[26]

The matters before the Authority were not complex which was reflected in the

duration of the Investigation Meeting.

[27]

Taking all these considerations into account, I order GFL to pay Mr Horan a

contribution to costs in the sum of $3,500.00, pursuant to clause 15 of Schedule 2 of the
Employment Relations Act 2000.
