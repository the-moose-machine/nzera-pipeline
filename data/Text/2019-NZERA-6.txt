COSTS DETERMINATION OF THE AUTHORITY

A.

The parties are to meet their own costs.

Employment relationship problem
[1]

The applicant withdrew her personal grievance application on or about 23

October 2018. The respondent seeks costs of $2,500 and disbursements of $100. Its
actual costs are alleged to have been $4,500 plus GST and disbursements of $250.
What is the starting point for assessing costs?
[2]

The Authority has adopted a notional daily tariff based approach to costs.1

Matters lodged in the Authority from 1 August 2016 are subject to a daily tariff of
1

Mattingly v Strata Title Management Ltd [2014] NZEmpC 15 at [16].

$4,500.2 The tariff is based upon there being preparation for and attendance at a
hearing and is also inclusive of a party’s usual disbursements.
[3]

It was agreed this matter could be dealt with upon the papers. For a matter

determined upon the papers i.e. without holding an investigation meeting, there must a
reduction to reflect the fact no attendance at an investigation meeting was required.
[4]

An appropriate starting point would have been half the daily tariff. There is

nothing from the record or in submissions that indicates a higher starting point is
warranted.
[5]

Therefore the starting point for assessing costs is $2,250. This is inclusive of

any disbursements.
Are there any factors that warrant adjusting the notional daily tariff?
Factors which warrant a reduction in the notional daily tariff
[6]

The applicant submits the costs tariff ought to be reduced because she suffers

from anxiety and depression and has limited income. She has provided a breakdown
of her living expenses. This showed a weekly deficit of $7.54. She has also provided
medical evidence to support her ill health.
[7]

The Court has held the circumstances of the parties are important when

determining costs.3
[8]

Here the respondent has resources to meet its costs. In contrast the applicant is

on a WINZ benefit, is currently in a weekly financial deficit and is dependent upon
her grown children for support. An award of costs would produce extreme hardship,
even if it was a token amount.
[9]

Costs cannot become a deterrent to parties being able to access the Authority.

This is especially relevant to parties whom are unwell and financially constrained.
For the applicant English was a second language. This may have contributed to the
delays in resolving her case.
[10]

To award costs in these circumstances is punitive.
